sphereclone
===========

As yet unnamed clone of the Sphere engine.

This project aims to have a better formed, simpler API than the original engine, with compatibility functions provided by a JavaScript shim.

The engine will provide file access and an interface to SDL functions. It is planned to implement the majority of Sphere format decoding in JS.
